    # You can set the "channels" option on each item configured here, this will
    # dispatch profilers into various loggers depending on their configured
    # channel. Channel is set either:
    #   - at the Profiler instance entry, using the "channel" tag.
    #   - at the ProfilerContextAware implementation, using a compiler pass.
    # The given array is a list of arbitrary names, each one can be prefixed
    # using ! case in which this channel will be blacklisted.
    # You cannot mix whitelist and blacklist.
    # If nothing provided, all channels will go throught.
